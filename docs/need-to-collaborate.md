# Need to Collaborate

A single person is not capable of fulfilling every request, and as software
engineers have learned that a monolithic approach is fragile and inflexible,
they should also learn that a single bot will not be able to solve every
problem. A bot needs to be aware that it can't solve every problem itself. A bot
needs to have access to additional resources that may exist around it. A bot
needs to be able to realize that they can't fulfill a request and know how to
ask for assistance, from both humans as well as other bots.
