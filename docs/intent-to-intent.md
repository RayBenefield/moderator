# Intent to Intent

It is common for bots to be built to recognize intents from humans, however
after an intent is discovered, what is communicated back to the human is
conveyed text. If instead a bot responds with its own intent, then that intent
can be communicated to machines as well. For example, a bot can send back an
intent to open the preferences page of the client if you are talking to the bot
on a website. This also enables bots to talk to each other better using
explicitly intents without having to setup context. Options can also be shared
as intents to be chosen by users and that intent can be directly communicated to
another bot without processing understanding.
