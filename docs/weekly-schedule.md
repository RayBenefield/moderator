## Goal

With as limited as my side project time is, and how complicated life interactions can be, I need to make sure my own expectations and consumer expectations are properly set. I want to shoot for a 1 week publishing cycle. I originally started this project on Tuesday, which is kind of perfect for me.


## Day Objectives

I have about 2 hours every weekday on the Caltrain (1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon). On the weekends I need to remain flexible and not have any major deadlines to meet on the weekends. So Tuesday works as the major release day as it gives me 2 expected hours prior to Tuesday to prepare and finalize things.

 - **Tuesday** - Release the latest minor/major version
 - **Wednesday** - Code this week's features
 - **Thursday** - Code this week's features
 - **Friday** - Finish up coding this week's features
 - **Saturday** - Document ALL THE THINGS
 - **Sunday** - Document ALL THE THINGS
 - **Monday** - Prepare for publishing

With the above structure it allows me to not have any hard obligations on the weekend so I can spend time with the family without any stressors. I may have some cleanup to do on coding or refactoring but that is easy in the early morning before anybody wakes up. But it should all be completely minor.


## Expectation

The above schedule gives me about 6 hours of solid coding time a week. And with that information I'll be able to better judge what I can get done in a week. The other 4 days are documenting, ideation, project management, public interaction, research, etc. Projects definitely require this much work around the coding. And this should be just enough to be successful. We'll see how this works out and then adjust moving forward.
