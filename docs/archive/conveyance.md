# Conveyance

Most bot systems around communicate with users directly with text. Instead of
communicating directly with text, instead I propose communicating outward with
intents and entities and then conveying those intents and entities with a
conveyance system. Whether it be a randomized set of strings, or a complex
sentence constructor I think there is a lot of potential in having conversation
structure happen strictly with intents and having outer layers that not only
analyze for intents, but also convey intents.
