# Desire to Learn

All bots should have access to a domain that enables learning. A bot will be
able to grow by realizing that it doesn't recognize what the interactor intends.
When it recognizes that, it will be able to ask for more information like "What
are the important parts of your statement". This will store these potential
important parts as potential entities of that statement for annotation. This
potential intent with potential entities is stored in the bots memory to be
accessed later as a repository of things the bot thinks it should learn. Bots
should act as humans would, realize that they are missing information and keep
that in mind and aspire to fill in the gaps over time. There needs to be a
yearning for knowledge.
