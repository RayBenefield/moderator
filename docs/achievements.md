It took three days to get an MVP actually working. I mean it is crude, but it works for now. It setups the major structure that needed to be in place to show that the concept works. It uses RxJS Observables in order to manage the conversation flow in a declaritive fashion. It only works on with a single recognizer and a single channel. Also doesn't do anything on the internets yet (rest server setup still required). It also doesn't even recognize anything beyond a hard string. It doesn't do anything special with the message structure either. Lots to still implement, but the structure is there.

I only just really discovered RxJS and Functional Reactive Programming about a few weeks ago. When I thought about that and the Microsoft Bots Framework using a waterfall system to handle conversations, I knew it was a natural fit. I'm excited to move forward. I still have to do a lot of devops, but consider the prototype done. On to more documentation and planning. I'm hoping this weekend I can put it out as a 0.1.0, so it is out there and in the wild. So much to do, and now we are on my personal difficult part. I've never actually published anything because I'm a perfectionist, but I've gotten over that and have learned that with short fast iteration cycles, awesome git skills, refactoring, and documentation, I can finally get past my publishing anxiety. AWAY!!!
