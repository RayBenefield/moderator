## Initial Thoughts

`Moderator` should be able to grow as the market continues to grow. Because chatbots are still in their infancy, the framework needs to be prepared to take on new tools. It needs to be able to keep up with new Messaging Channels, NLP Engines, API Changes, Storage Options, etc.


### NLP Engines

 - Wit.ai
 - Api.ai
 - Luis


### Channels

 - SMS
 - Facebook Messenger
 - Twitter
 - Slack
