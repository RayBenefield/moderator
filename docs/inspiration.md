### Inspiration

Currently the main inspiration of this framework comes from Bot Framework (BotBuilder) by Microsoft. It provides a lot of structure to creating a conversation for a bot. However, I believe that chatbots can be created with declarative programming to make the code much easier to reason and much more flexible to the evolving market.
