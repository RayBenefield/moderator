# Moderator

Chatbots are a fast growing market and the technology behind them is still in their infancy. Moderator seeks to add to the expanding toolsets that exist for building chatbots by providing a declarative framework that makes reasoning a chatbot's conversational skills that much easier.


## NOTICE: Active Development

`Moderator` is still in its early stages of development. Feel free to watch this project as it grows and use the issues section to put in any questions or ideas you may have. Below you can see the basic summaries of each Minor version. Nothing in this project promises to be stable until we reach a `v1.0.0`.


#### v0.1.0

With this initial version we have setup the core skeleton of the moderator system. It ties together the bot, channels, recognizers, and branches. Because it only introduces the `Console` channel and the `Passthrough` recognizer, it doesn't provide any useful functionality. But it is still a major milestone. In future minor versions expect more channels (`Facebook`, `Slack`, `Skype`, etc.) and NLP recognizers (`WitAi`, `ApiAi`, or `Luis`).



## Install

**NOTE:** *Moderator is currently not in a useable state, but you are free to explore to your heart's content.*
```
yarn add moderator
npm install --save moderator
npm i -S moderator
```


## Usage

See the [`examples/`](./examples/) directory for how everything ties together.


## Documentation

LOTS of documentation can be found in the [`docs/`](./docs/) folder including initial designs, inspiration, reasoning, plans, etc.
